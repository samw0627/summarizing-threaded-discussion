1) The sidewalk in front of your home is your responsibility to clear. Keep it clear edge to edge from ground to 6' high. Cut back or remove from the sidewalk bushes, hedges, roses, potted plants, your garbage, furniture, weeds, your car, whatever you're growing on your hell strip, lime bikes, scooters etc.
