In this comment, for those interested, here\u2019s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/15/1/6 Abstract The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) tools has transformed numerous aspects of daily life, yet its impact on critical thinking remains underexplored. This study investigates the relationship between AI tool usage and critical thinking skills, focusing on cognitive offloading as a mediating factor. Utilising a mixed-method approach, we conducted surveys and in-depth interviews with 666 participants across diverse age groups and educational backgrounds. Quantitative data were analysed using ANOVA and correlation analysis, while qualitative insights were obtained through thematic analysis of interview transcripts. The findings revealed a significant negative correlation between frequent AI tool usage and critical thinking abilities, mediated by increased cognitive offloading. Younger participants exhibited higher dependence on AI tools and lower critical thinking scores compared to older participants. Furthermore, higher educational attainment was associated with better critical thinking skills, regardless of AI usage. These results highlight the potential cognitive costs of AI tool reliance, emphasising the need for educational strategies that promote critical engagement with AI technologies. This study contributes to the growing discourse on AI\u2019s cognitive implications, offering practical recommendations for mitigating its adverse effects on critical thinking. The findings underscore the importance of fostering critical thinking in an AI-driven world, making this research essential reading for educators, policymakers, and technologists."

Talking about Wikip\u00e9dia or AI, the problem is not with the tool. The problem is some users don't know well the limitations of the tool. And in the case of AI use, they could think a well-shaped answer is a definitive truth, when it's sometimes controversial or inaccurate, but not presented this way by the AI."

Be it something mental, such as math, or physical, such as sports. You practice those things and your neurons get stronger. In the case of sports your muscles get stronger but also neurons that control those muscles, and through that your coordination. In the case of math the repeated practice of different equations strengthens the neurons responsible, which results in faster recognition of problems and their solutions. So what \"cognitive offloading\" does is instead of doing those calculations, that problem solving in your mind (and thus strengthening your problem solving neurons) you make AI solve it, and thus you don't develop and strengthen those neurons. Kind of like having a robot servant that carries your luggage, you won't develop your own muscles because you're not carrying the weight yourself."

I love using it to stress test my own ideas and find flaws in my thinking or explanations. I love drawing analogies to check my understanding and seeing if it can get back to the concept I'm explaining by feeding it my analogues or \"models\" of a concept I want to discuss. And whenever it gives me \"an answer\" or knowledge I didn't know before, I always stress test that in reverse.starting a new instance and seeing if it understands it's own idea. Sometimes it'll go \"never heard of that\" sometimes it confirms it and I can find more literature on it. But it's only a good tool if used actively. It's fuck awful as a passive tool I think. Both in quality and in impact on you as a thinker."

The researchers basically conducted a survey finding a correlation between use of AI and cognitive abilities. But, a simpler explanation for their finding is this: people with stronger cognitive abilities are probably just less reliant on AI in the first place. Am I missing something here? The qualitative review may go some ways toward their explanation, but still, I don\u2019t find that very convincing. It\u2019s easy for people to fall into the trap of assuming AI makes them less critical thinkers. That\u2019s certainly more palatable than accepting you weren\u2019t a critical thinker in the first place."
