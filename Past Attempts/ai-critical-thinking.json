Thankfully, while it took us a while to adapt, but now we've found a way to train students to think critically while still allowing the use of AI.

The moment students skip out on the first critical thinking exercises by resorting to Chatgpt, they avoid laying the foundations that they need over the next four years. We've avoided this problem by reworking all our tests into critical thinking applications. So they do verbal presentations, pressure cooker sessions where they need to apply their skills in new contexts, timed capture the flags on physical devices without access to the Internet, verbal assessments, they do classroom exercises where they give each other feedback and they brainstorm ideas together...

For example, for a written report, they might use AI to write the report, but the written report is an entry requirement for a verbal assessment. Once they clear that hurdle, they have to explain their reasoning for certain choices in the report, or explain logical structures. If they can do that, we ask them how designs or conclusions would change if certain conditions or circumstances would change. We ask them about conflicting conditions and guidelines, how they would navigate that, whether that would lead to complications in this situation... We do the same for coding. Sure, you might use AI to write the code, but then I manually change the data structures they use as input. Someone who wrote the code should, realistically, be able to adjust their entire program based my cues. Or I ask them to add a new method to their class, using specific inputs and outputs. We ask them why they used certain code structures, what the impact is on the functioning of the program, that sort of thing. So, long story short, they might use AI, but we don't assess students on the products they deliver, we assess them on their ability to apply the skills they needed to create those products in new situations."

Talking about Wikip\u00e9dia or AI, the problem is not with the tool. The problem is some users don't know well the limitations of the tool. And in the case of AI use, they could think a well-shaped answer is a definitive truth, when it's sometimes controversial or inaccurate, but not presented this way by the AI."

This has a direct impact on our basic reasoning and decision making capabilities. And no, it'd be more accurate to say that cognitive offloading refers to the *byproduct* of such trust. Your brain quite literally becomes less capable at that task, as it subconsciously determines it isn't necessary. Whatever your thoughts on AI, this should be concerning to everyone. Even if you were to feed it your every thought, and it were fully up to the task of parsing through it for you, there's still a crucial disconnect between its thoughts and your own."

Be it something mental, such as math, or physical, such as sports. You practice those things and your neurons get stronger. In the case of sports your muscles get stronger but also neurons that control those muscles, and through that your coordination. In the case of math the repeated practice of different equations strengthens the neurons responsible, which results in faster recognition of problems and their solutions. So what \"cognitive offloading\" does is instead of doing those calculations, that problem solving in your mind (and thus strengthening your problem solving neurons) you make AI solve it, and thus you don't develop and strengthen those neurons. Kind of like having a robot servant that carries your luggage, you won't develop your own muscles because you're not carrying the weight yourself."

Seriously though, if you're always cognitive offloading, you won't develop knowledge and insights that helps to inform your views and reactions to the world properly. It's like been in a conversation and knowing that you could look up the location of paris, tokyo and their surrounding cities... and then not having the opportunity to do so without interrupting that conversation. Or worst yet, you don't even know what paris and tokyo are, and you don't know that there are surrounding cities - so you don't even understand the conversation at hand. In other words, you gotta know a few things so that you can think about those things and connect other things you might know to those things - that interconnected web of information makes a person knowledgeable, interesting and insightful. A person that eschews the work to create that interconnected web of knowledge is by contrast... ignorant, boring and dull. Speed of information access is important, and having it in your brain gives you the greatest speed and access to it. Something more simple like time or car speed can be offloaded to external mechanisms - especially when the cost of looking it up is small, it's reliable, and the cost of maintaining it cognitively, accurately is high."

The year I was finally allowed to submit code instead of line by line proofs, was when I was able to finally start understanding it. Was it because the fundamentals had been beaten into me first? I know that\u2019s the common argument. But let me tell you that the cognitive load of that schedule, of the world going on around us, everything; it really was just a blur of stress, hand cramps from being forced to manually write out everything, and doing just enough of what I was told so I wouldn\u2019t fail, so I\u2019d have enough time to move to the next thing that was on fire."

This can often completely remove the student from the material entirely, whereas the internet did not do that. The internet just brought the information from the library into your bedroom. It outsourced the walking to the library and the using of the dewey decimal system. People might not be so great at finding their material in a library, but can still analyze the information and discuss it in a comprehensible way. If AI does your research and writes your paper, how do you then discuss the paper in a comprehensible way? I would liken it to the damage on a persons education by plagiarism, as that is a more apt comparison. Students are removing themselves from the material entirely."
