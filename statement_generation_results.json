It is being done because the political leaders in this city receive campaign contributions and kickbacks from property owners who own downtown buildings. They are trying to increase the usage of services, boost sales, and occupy buildings.\n\nSome tasks can be carried out remotely as effectively as in person, while others benefit from team collaboration, interdepartmental teams, and providing mentorship for new employees. The commute to downtown is a concern, but long-term city employees should have already taken that into account when applying for and accepting their positions. Downtown is well-served by public transit, roads, bus connections, ferries, trains, etc. This does not mean commuting there is easy or pleasant, but it is better than other locations."
