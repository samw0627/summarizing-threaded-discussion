Abstract

The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) tools has transformed numerous aspects of daily life, yet its impact on critical thinking remains underexplored. This study investigates the relationship between AI tool usage and critical thinking skills, focusing on cognitive offloading as a mediating factor. Utilising a mixed-method approach, we conducted surveys and in-depth interviews with 666 participants across diverse age groups and educational backgrounds. Quantitative data were analysed using ANOVA and correlation analysis, while qualitative insights were obtained through thematic analysis of interview transcripts. The findings revealed a significant negative correlation between frequent AI tool usage and critical thinking abilities, mediated by increased cognitive offloading. Younger participants exhibited higher dependence on AI tools and lower critical thinking scores compared to older participants. Furthermore, higher educational attainment was associated with better critical thinking skills, regardless of AI usage. These results highlight the potential cognitive costs of AI tool reliance, emphasising the need for educational strategies that promote critical engagement with AI technologies. This study contributes to the growing discourse on AI’s cognitive implications, offering practical recommendations for mitigating its adverse effects on critical thinking. The findings underscore the importance of fostering critical thinking in an AI-driven world, making this research essential reading for educators, policymakers, and technologists.

AI tools may weaken critical thinking skills by encouraging cognitive offloading, study suggests

A new study published in the journal Societies suggests that frequent reliance on artificial intelligence tools may negatively affect critical thinking skills. People who used AI tools more frequently demonstrated weaker critical thinking abilities, largely due to a cognitive phenomenon known as cognitive offloading. This effect was particularly pronounced among younger individuals, while those with higher education levels tended to retain stronger critical thinking skills regardless of AI tool usage.

The results indicated a strong negative correlation between frequent AI tool usage and critical thinking abilities. Participants who reported heavy reliance on AI tools performed worse on critical thinking assessments compared to those who used these tools less frequently.

Cognitive offloading played a significant role in this relationship. Participants who frequently delegated cognitive tasks to AI tools, such as using search engines for quick answers or relying on recommendation algorithms for decision-making, exhibited weaker critical thinking skills. This pattern suggests that AI tools may be reducing the need for individuals to engage in independent analysis and evaluation.

Age and education level were also important factors. Younger participants (aged 17–25) showed higher AI tool usage and greater cognitive offloading, which coincided with lower critical thinking scores. In contrast, older participants (aged 46 and above) demonstrated stronger critical thinking skills and were less reliant on AI tools.

Education level played a protective role—those with higher education tended to maintain strong critical thinking skills, even if they used AI tools frequently. This suggests that formal education may provide individuals with strategies to critically assess AI-generated information rather than accepting it uncritically.",0,mvea,43,1742558638.0,miyknzt,1jgf6eo,1.0,"critical thinking, ai tools, cognitive offloading, educational strategies, peer-reviewed journal, educational attainment",6

"Oh, definitely. But it's getting worse. I'm a teacher at a university of applied sciences, and I've noticed a sharp decline in my students' problem solving and critical thinking skills. Students can regurgitate knowledge without a problem, but applying it in new situations or contexts.. That's a no go. And that means that they're progressing much, much slower than my previous cohorts of students. Thankfully, while it took us a while to adapt, but now we've found a way to train students to think critically while still allowing the use of AI. However, this has made our educational track a lot more difficult for some students who, previously, might still have eked by just by sheer force of will.",2,Zygomatico,65,1742572866.0,mizsb7d,mizem8j,1.0,critical thinking,1
"Tbh the education system in most countries incentivizes memorization rather than critical thinking in many areas, tests are all about remembering pointless information you will soon forget since you are not using it in any meaningful way.

"Oh, entirely true. And learning just to recite stuff by heart isn't really mastering the topic. I mean, then you're just stuck at the lower two levels of Bloom's taxonomy. In my specific case, we help students develop their cyber security knowledge, so then it's more relevant. Critical thinking and analysis is part of the core of our field. The moment students skip out on the first critical thinking exercises by resorting to Chatgpt, they avoid laying the foundations that they need over the next four years.

We've avoided this problem by reworking all our tests into critical thinking applications. So they do verbal presentations, pressure cooker sessions where they need to apply their skills in new contexts, timed capture the flags on physical devices without access to the Internet, verbal assessments, they do classroom exercises where they give each other feedback and they brainstorm ideas together... It's a fun solution.",4,Zygomatico,11,1742575103.0,mizzxz3,mizvvmy,1.0,"critical thinking, bloom's taxonomy, verbal assessments, pressure cooker sessions, classroom exercises",5
"I mentioned it in a different comment here. Our rubric assesses critical thinking, so our testing methods put students in a situation where they have to apply those skills. For example, for a written report, they might use AI to write the report, but the written report is an entry requirement for a verbal assessment. Once they clear that hurdle, they have to explain their reasoning for certain choices in the report, or explain logical structures. If they can do that, we ask them how designs or conclusions would change if certain conditions or circumstances would change. We ask them about conflicting conditions and guidelines, how they would navigate that, whether that would lead to complications in this situation...

We do the same for coding. Sure, you might use AI to write the code, but then I manually change the data structures they use as input. Someone who wrote the code should, realistically, be able to adjust their entire program based my cues. Or I ask them to add a new method to their class, using specific inputs and outputs. We ask them why they used certain code structures, what the impact is on the functioning of the program, that sort of thing.

So, long story short, they might use AI, but we don't assess students on the products they deliver, we assess them on their ability to apply the skills they needed to create those products in new situations.",4,Zygomatico,13,1742589164.0,mj1cbuy,mj16ieu,1.0,"critical thinking, verbal assessments",2
"How to tell a person that engages heavily in cognitive offloading!

Seriously though, if you're always cognitive offloading, you won't develop knowledge and insights that helps to inform your views and reactions to the world properly.

It's like been in a conversation and knowing that you could look up the location of paris, tokyo and their surrounding cities... and then not having the opportunity to do so without interrupting that conversation.

Or worst yet, you don't even know what paris and tokyo are, and you don't know that there are surrounding cities - so you don't even understand the conversation at hand.

In other words, you gotta know a few things so that you can think about those things and connect other things you might know to those things - that interconnected web of information makes a person knowledgeable, interesting and insightful.

A person that eschews the work to create that interconnected web of knowledge is by contrast... ignorant, boring and dull.

Speed of information access is important, and having it in your brain gives you the greatest speed and access to it.

Something more simple like time or car speed can be offloaded to external mechanisms - especially when the cost of looking it up is small, it's reliable, and the cost of maintaining it cognitively, accurately is high.",1,Zaptruder,15,1742567010.0,miz8fbp,miz0sza,0.8285714285714285,"cognitive offloading, information access",2

"Glancing over the paper very quickly, this study was poorly conducted. Subjects’ use of AI tools was not randomly assigned. The researchers basically conducted a survey finding a correlation between use of AI and cognitive abilities.

But, a simpler explanation for their finding is this: people with stronger cognitive abilities are probably just less reliant on AI in the first place.

Am I missing something here? The qualitative review may go some ways toward their explanation, but still, I don’t find that very convincing. It’s easy for people to fall into the trap of assuming AI makes them less critical thinkers.

"The difference here is that what's being offloaded is far more fundamental than keeping time, or even something like math or navigation. This has a direct impact on our basic reasoning and decision making capabilities.

And no, it'd be more accurate to say that cognitive offloading refers to the *byproduct* of such trust. Your brain quite literally becomes less capable at that task, as it subconsciously determines it isn't necessary.

Whatever your thoughts on AI, this should be concerning to everyone. Even if you were to feed it your every thought, and it were fully up to the task of parsing through it for you, there's still a crucial disconnect between its thoughts and your own.",1,Undeity,11,1742589744.0,mj1e9ka,miz0sza,0.7714285714285714,cognitive offloading,1
"Using the word ""trust"" is weird to me.

I think it's better to look at this from a neurological perspective. When you do something neurons are formed in your brain. Be it something mental, such as math, or physical, such as sports. You practice those things and your neurons get stronger.

In the case of sports your muscles get stronger but also neurons that control those muscles, and through that your coordination.

In the case of math the repeated practice of different equations strengthens the neurons responsible, which results in faster recognition of problems and their solutions.

So what ""cognitive offloading"" does is instead of doing those calculations, that problem solving in your mind (and thus strengthening your problem solving neurons) you make AI solve it, and thus you don't develop and strengthen those neurons.

Kind of like having a robot servant that carries your luggage, you won't develop your own muscles because you're not carrying the weight yourself.",1,belloch,13,1742594374.0,mj1t2v8,miz0sza,0.7714285714285714,cognitive offloading,1
"I agree wirh you. Cognitive offloading at its core is a form of trust. We’ve always relied on tools to save mental effort from watches to notebooks.
