"In my experience, students just use AI to bypass learning altogether. They just ask the AI, jot down whatever, and dont actually retain anything.

"AI is most effective as a supplemental tool, not as a full replacement for teaching. Using AI to make personalized lesson plans may hurt students more than help, as teachers will have to time verifying that AI is not feeding incorrect information. AI lacks depth on many topics and for anything STEM related, more often than not, it’s just wrong. 

I would also argue that AI generally does not keep people motivated, as most students use it as a means of cheating. It makes people complacent and less willing to think for themselves or understand the material. If used properly, that can be mitigated, but it won’t be used properly by most.

There is also the fact that using AI to teach is considered by many to be lazy. Charging tuition while paying thousands for a quality education seems a bit disingenuous, as that tuition is meant to pay for lessons from professors. As a tool that professors use? Sure. As a substitute for actual lesson planning?

">AI makes learning more fun and interesting by adjusting to how each student learns. 

It really depends on what you're calling ""AI"" here. LLMs can certainly adjust things, but they tend to be horrifically wrong fairly often when asking the kinds of extremely broad or very specific questions education requires. 

>In school, this means students don’t have to wait for others or feel lost when they need extra help. 

AI is not needed for LMSs (Learning Management Systems) to customize paths based on progress or level of understanding. This is done via simple algorithms and learning path creation. In fact, AI would actively hamper these efforts by making them needlessly complex and subjective to an AI black box. 

>AI uses games, quizzes, and instant feedback to keep students involved and motivated.

Again, this has nothing to do with AI, and inserting AI actively makes it worse. Educational games need to be rigorously beta tested to ensure all roads lead to the correct answer. Allowing AI to adjust these things on the fly ensures there will be more problems than there are today. 

>It also helps teachers by personalizing lessons and making it easier to spot when someone needs support. 

How does AI help teachers identify who needs support in ways that couldn't be better identified with simple online or in-person check ins? 

>Overall, AI creates a more engaging and effective learning experience for everyone.

"As a language teacher:

* Yes, gamification, instant feedback, multimedia, interactive environments, etc, are very useful tools, at least as a supplement to other types of learning. But none of this has anything to do with AI. All of this has existed long before AI.

So if you compare an AI app to another app that uses quizzes, gamification, instant feedback, etc, then the app without AI will be more likely to show the same stuff to everyone, and if it adjusts to your individual needs it will be in a very crude way.
* However, very targeted and customized learning is nothing that's particular to AI either: you can have it if you take private classes with a teacher, and pay the teacher enough to create customized lessons for you. And at the current state of AI, human teachers are still better than AI to assess your individual needs and weaknesses and to develop a customized plan for you.
