"In my experience, students just use AI to bypass learning altogether. They just ask the AI, jot down whatever, and dont actually retain anything. 

  
Its like how having a calculator always accessible makes you less likely to be good at mental arithmetic. The calculator is such a good tool for mental arithmetic, that you never do the required struggling to actually get good at it.",0,Nrdman,14,1748887324.0,mvmmrhw,1l1o8ts,"ai tools, cognitive offloading, education system, educational strategies, ai integration, cognitive skills, information access, educational attainment, ai dependency",9
Yeah exactly its like giving students a calculator for math and then being surprised when they cant do basic arithmetic without it anymore because they never actually learned the fundamentals,1,Organic-Artist-6684,2,1748950477.0,mvr3eli,mvmmrhw,"cognitive offloading, education system, educational strategies, cognitive skills, educational attainment",5
Totally agree. If students just let AI do the work they won’t really learn anything. It’s like always using a calculator because you never get good at math in your head. AI should help not do everything. Teachers need to make sure students use it the right way.,1,Ok-Common-168,1,1748888177.0,mvmpqui,mvmmrhw,"ai tools, education system, educational strategies, ai integration, educational attainment, ai dependency",6

"it’s not really different. Both statements say AI helps learning when used the right way, with student effort and good teaching.

">AI watches how students answer questions and adjusts lessons to help them where they struggle.

Is this a projection of what you *think* AI does, or do you have any actual evidence that this is how it works?

"AI is most effective as a supplemental tool, not as a full replacement for teaching. Using AI to make personalized lesson plans may hurt students more than help, as teachers will have to time verifying that AI is not feeding incorrect information. AI lacks depth on many topics and for anything STEM related, more often than not, it’s just wrong. 

I would also argue that AI generally does not keep people motivated, as most students use it as a means of cheating. It makes people complacent and less willing to think for themselves or understand the material. If used properly, that can be mitigated, but it won’t be used properly by most.

There is also the fact that using AI to teach is considered by many to be lazy. Charging tuition while paying thousands for a quality education seems a bit disingenuous, as that tuition is meant to pay for lessons from professors. As a tool that professors use? Sure. As a substitute for actual lesson planning? Lazy",0,poopiepickle,2,1748887730.0,mvmo6rc,1l1o8ts,"critical thinking, ai tools, cognitive offloading, education system, educational strategies, ai integration, cognitive skills, information access, educational attainment, ai dependency",10
">AI makes learning more fun and interesting by adjusting to how each student learns. 

It really depends on what you're calling ""AI"" here. LLMs can certainly adjust things, but they tend to be horrifically wrong fairly often when asking the kinds of extremely broad or very specific questions education requires. 

>In school, this means students don’t have to wait for others or feel lost when they need extra help. 

AI is not needed for LMSs (Learning Management Systems) to customize paths based on progress or level of understanding. This is done via simple algorithms and learning path creation. In fact, AI would actively hamper these efforts by making them needlessly complex and subjective to an AI black box. 

>AI uses games, quizzes, and instant feedback to keep students involved and motivated.

Again, this has nothing to do with AI, and inserting AI actively makes it worse. Educational games need to be rigorously beta tested to ensure all roads lead to the correct answer. Allowing AI to adjust these things on the fly ensures there will be more problems than there are today. 

>It also helps teachers by personalizing lessons and making it easier to spot when someone needs support. 

How does AI help teachers identify who needs support in ways that couldn't be better identified with simple online or in-person check ins? 

>Overall, AI creates a more engaging and effective learning experience for everyone.

Except in every example you gave, other technology is both more reliable and more objective in the online learning experience.",0,WorldsGreatestWorst,2,1748889592.0,mvmumy5,1l1o8ts,"ai tools, education system, problem solving skills, educational strategies, verbal assessments, graduate school interns, ai integration, educational attainment, ai dependency",9
"There are two potential issues with AI and AI learning:  
1. AI can't push you compared to the teacher (good teacher, obviously). If you are interested by yourself, good for you, but if you are not interested, AI can't force you to learn anything.

2. AI can destroy the main goal of learning. If the AI kills the jobs, and the primary target of learning is the future better jobs, AI will kill the main target of learning, thus removing any desire to learn for the vast majority of students.",0,ScrupulousArmadillo,2,1748886334.0,mvmj6qx,1l1o8ts,"ai tools, education system, educational strategies, ai integration, educational attainment, ai dependency",6
"1.AI can’t replace a good teacher’s ability to motivate and challenge students. If a student isn’t interested, AI won’t push them like a passionate teacher might.

"Some studies show AI helps in schools. A 2024 review looked at 66 studies where AI supported learning through quizzes, feedback, and progress tracking.

"See, this is exactly what I dislike about AI. You asked the computer to find these sources, and then did little effort to review either the sources themselves or how well the AI description mapped to the source. After all, while the second study you cite does seem oriented around outcomes to at least some extent, the first one doesn't seem to suggest that AI helps in school at all. It points to the areas of research that are being done, and it notes places where AI sees use in schools, but it does not apparently come to or support any conclusions about the efficacy of AI in a school environment.

At the end of the day, AI has areas of utility, but they seem rather narrow. AI is very good at telling people things they want to hear, has a tendency to hallucinate various flavors of nonsense, and ""speaks"" with a sort of confidence that encourages passive acceptance in its users. What happened here is far from the worst case I've seen. I've had people cite five studies at me, providing extensive explanation of their contents, and the studies bore essentially no relationship to the description and often went against the central claim being made.

"I guess I see what you mean. AI isn’t perfect and the research on how it works in schools is still figuring itself out. Some studies show it helps, others don’t say much or show limits. AI has its good points but also some real issues especially around accuracy and how people use it.

I think AI works best as a tool alongside teachers and when students think for themselves and not as a replacement. We just need to be careful and realistic about what it can do.",5,Ok-Common-168,-1,1748889357.0,mvmttnm,mvmqy85,"critical thinking, ai tools, education system, educational strategies, graduate school interns, ai integration, educational attainment, ai dependency",8
"Goal-driven AI will identify a struggling student and become more and more remedial, as the goal is to bridge the gap and make the student learn and pass the eventual test(s). 

Eventually, the student will be getting absolutely spoon fed CONSTANTLY, like having their actual mother standing over their shoulder while in class pointing the way. Just follow the prompts until you make it to the end... 

The individual AI doesn't actually care about stopping at ""hey, this is kind of bad for long-term development"" it ONLY cares about the individual work its doing, which is assisting with whatever module or subject or task it's on. So somebody real needs to define a bunch of parameters based on their own beliefs on what is and isn't good ""long term learning practice"" regardless.

"As a language teacher:

* Yes, gamification, instant feedback, multimedia, interactive environments, etc, are very useful tools, at least as a supplement to other types of learning. But none of this has anything to do with AI. All of this has existed long before AI.
* What AI can do that other materials can't is adjusting to your individual needs, as you said. So if you compare an AI app to another app that uses quizzes, gamification, instant feedback, etc, then the app without AI will be more likely to show the same stuff to everyone, and if it adjusts to your individual needs it will be in a very crude way.
* However, very targeted and customized learning is nothing that's particular to AI either: you can have it if you take private classes with a teacher, and pay the teacher enough to create customized lessons for you. And at the current state of AI, human teachers are still better than AI to assess your individual needs and weaknesses and to develop a customized plan for you.
