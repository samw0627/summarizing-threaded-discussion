Now that the pandemic is no longer keeping us all inside, I would venture to guess those numbers have stabilized.\n\nI agree with your last statement though. Employers should make decisions that are best for their employees (the humans that are doing the work), to best accomodate their preference as best they can. Obviously, some jobs need to be done in person. However, a large majority can be done from home, and done more efficiently. This further reduces traffic congestion (as we saw here in Seattle, and the nightmare traffic that returned once Amazon required workes to return to the office).",

We had meetings every quarter where leadership got online and talked about how we were beating revenue, our KPI's, etc.\n\nNow all the sudden once the situation has settled down, we need to \"get back into the office\" because \"productivity is down\" after multiple years of us kicking ass and experiencing huge stock gains all throughout the WFH era. Sounds like you already bought the bridge partner.\n\nBecause what it really is, is a bunch of Boomer bosses that don't like change, a bunch of middle managers that need to justify their existence, and a C-Suite that needs to justify the leases and ownership of these giant ass buildings. Meanwhile whenever I come in there's tons of inefficiencies. People have to commute and run into traffic and are late for meetings, sometimes their childcare falls through and they have to handle that and are stuck at home anyway, all the fucking bullshitting about Debbie's stupid kids and Craig's failing marriage in the hallway, the lunches that all the sudden turn from an hour in front of my home computer to hour and a half plus in the cafe because I'm with the team and the aforementioned bullshitting runs long... I could go on and on.\n\nThey also haven't even bothered hiring back half the staff that made coming in even worth it. No onsite IT, EA's are down, there's not enough seats/offices to go around because we've hired so much, the morale budget hasn't been brought back up to speed and we don't even get to have the traditional events, happy hours, gifts, etc. anymore.\n\nI go in about twice a week when my manager and most of my team is in because I actually like my team and I am close to campus so I can't really bitch all that much. But if I had the commute some of my teammates do, you'd be lucky to see my ass more than once every other week.

Another day in office increases commuting costs, childcare and pet care costs, cuts down on free time, etc.... City employees are not about to start going to happy hours and shopping after work because they're required to be their. They're about to start bringing their lunches and coffees from home.....",
