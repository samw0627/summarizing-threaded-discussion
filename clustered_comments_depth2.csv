"What the heck are you talking about?

Was at one of the big 3 around here when COVID hit, guess what? Nothing stopped. We all went home, logged in, and kept doing the job.

Products got released on time, contracts were signed on time, big deals were made on time. We had meetings every quarter where leadership got online and talked about how we were beating revenue, our KPI's, etc.

Now all the sudden once the situation has settled down, we need to ""get back into the office"" because ""productivity is down"" after multiple years of us kicking ass and experiencing huge stock gains all throughout the WFH era. Sounds like you already bought the bridge partner.

Because what it really is, is a bunch of Boomer bosses that don't like change, a bunch of middle managers that need to justify their existence, and a C-Suite that needs to justify the leases and ownership of these giant ass buildings. Meanwhile whenever I come in there's tons of inefficiencies. People have to commute and run into traffic and are late for meetings, sometimes their childcare falls through and they have to handle that and are stuck at home anyway, all the fucking bullshitting about Debbie's stupid kids and Craig's failing marriage in the hallway, the lunches that all the sudden turn from an hour in front of my home computer to hour and a half plus in the cafe because I'm with the team and the aforementioned bullshitting runs long... I could go on and on.

They also haven't even bothered hiring back half the staff that made coming in even worth it. No onsite IT, EA's are down, there's not enough seats/offices to go around because we've hired so much, the morale budget hasn't been brought back up to speed and we don't even get to have the traditional events, happy hours, gifts, etc. anymore.

I go in about twice a week when my manager and most of my team is in because I actually like my team and I am close to campus so I can't really bitch all that much.
