Cut back or remove from the sidewalk bushes, hedges, roses, potted plants, your garbage, furniture, weeds, your car, whatever you're growing on your hell strip, lime bikes, scooters etc. 2) Cars yield to pedestrians, wheelchair users, and everyone else. If someone is crossing the street you stop, you don't honk. 3) If you have a temporary disability placard it doesn't mean you should park in disabled stalls. Disabled stalls are for people who need them. If you don't need them, don't use them. If the stall is the wider wheelchair access ramp stall, don't use it unless you or a passenger are in a wheelchair that you have to unload from the vehicle. 4) Leash your dog. Leash it in parks, leash it on walks."
