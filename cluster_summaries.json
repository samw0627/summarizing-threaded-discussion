        "I walk around Seattle for a living and it can be really difficult and dangerous for an able-bodied person to get around. I can't imagine the difficulty disabled people have getting around the city. It is so frustrating hearing people not want sidewalks because they dont want to lose parking spots.",
        "Disabled people should have an outsized say in city planning, it makes it so much better",
        "I agree, it would benefit everyone if city planning was based around disabled people, seeing as a high tide lifts all boats and everyone is going to lose mobility at some point or another, provided one lives long enough.",
        "Along with infrastructure, disabled people are constantly harassed for service animals, standing or sitting in the front of the buses (disabled and elderly seating) if they do not look visibly disabled. \n\nThe slippery slope argument is bullshit, if people constantly have to prove disability (means testing, papers, ensuring they are doing the specific amount of work they are required to do for disability benefit) it seems no different than attacks on other marginalized peoples.",
        "I’ve had to report bus drivers for refusing to let people with mobility devices onto the bus when all the handicapped seats were empty.  I guess they think it’s too much work to deal with? Fucked up."

        "exactly this. its just another prime example of why inclusivity and representation matters. \n\nI had this same concern when we were deciding to have kids, too. The number of sidewalks that just disappear and like the article said, curbs cuts are practically non-existent in some areas. Not trying to diminish the article with my own experience of navigating a stroller, just highlighting how ADA accessibility is important and extends beyond the disabled community. It benefits everyone.",
        "Curb cuts! They are enforced as part of the ADA, but everyone else enjoys the benefits of being able to roll things onto the sidewalk.",
        "I’ve been walking around my neighborhood with a stroller twice a day for the last month. It gives huge empathy for disabled people now that I’m realized how inaccessible the sidewalks are for wheels, and how at least half of intersections on neighborhood streets don’t have any curb cuts at all.",
        "“After my injury, there were many challenges navigating the built environment, especially when it came to sidewalks. The lack of curb cuts was prevalent,\" Sepulveda said. \"Also, the sidewalk was in poor condition.\"”\n\nI didn’t realize how bad the sidewalks are until I had a baby and started pushing a stroller, the city walks are horrible \n\nAnd didn’t the city get sued for like a million for a person that fell walking on the sidewalk?\n\nYet people wonder why I’m upset about Bruce’s $6 million a year “cover up graffiti” spending waste. Literally 0 return on investment, every time the city pants over the graffiti it’s back in like a day.",
        "A list of disabled grievances:\n\n1) The sidewalk in front of your home is your responsibility to clear. Keep it clear edge to edge from ground to 6' high. Cut back or remove from the sidewalk bushes, hedges, roses, potted plants, your garbage, furniture, weeds, your car, whatever you're growing on your hell strip, lime bikes, scooters etc.\n2) Cars yield to pedestrians, wheelchair users, and everyone else. If someone is crossing the street you stop, you don't honk.\n3) If you have a temporary disability placard it doesn't mean you should park in disabled stalls. Disabled stalls are for people who need them. If you don't need them, don't use them. If the stall is the wider wheelchair access ramp stall, don't use it unless you or a passenger are in a wheelchair that you have to unload from the vehicle.\n4) Leash your dog. Leash it in parks, leash it on walks."
